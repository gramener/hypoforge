The pharmaceutical company has invented a pill which is as effective and safe as an injectable. They want to maximize the possible target market and patients to reach out to. Target patients could be those who are already on injectables, those who are on pills but are ready to switch to injectables, and those who face barriers or challenges with current injectable therapies. Think holistically, incorporating clinical, geographical, behavioral, and socio-economic factors to maximize the target market for an impactful drug launch.
